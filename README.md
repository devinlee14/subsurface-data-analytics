# subsurface-data-analytics

I am a Geology graduate with background in petrophysics and 
professional experience as a Data Analyst.
This portfolio demonstrates how data analytics and Python
can be applied to subsurface and production problems
in the oil & gas industry.

## Portfolio Objective
- Demonstrate practical subsurface data analysis skills
- Bridge geoscience knowledge with data analytics
- Showcase industry-relevant workflows

## Projects
### 1. Petrophysical Analysis from Well Logs
Well log quality control, petrophysical calculations
(Vsh, porosity, water saturation), and net pay estimation
using Python.

### 2. Production Data Analysis & Decline Curve
Production data cleaning, decline curve analysis,
and basic production forecasting.

### 3. Machine Learning for Reservoir & Production Insights
Application of basic machine learning techniques
to subsurface and production datasets.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Lasio
- Jupyter Notebook
